## Implementation Approach

This version takes a more traditional web development approach using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Key features include:

- **Modular CSS**: Separated into base, layout, and font stylesheets for better organization
- **Responsive Design**: Built with a mobile-first approach
- **Component-Based Structure**: Each section (header, experience, education, etc.) is modular and reusable
- **Custom Icons**: Using custom icon implementations for skills and social links
- **Clean Typography**: Custom font implementation for professional appearance

## Technical Choices

- **Vanilla Stack**: Using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for simplicity and performance
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: Modern layout techniques for responsive design
- **Custom Components**: Building reusable components without framework dependencies
- **Optimized Assets**: Efficient handling of images and fonts

## Key Features

- Professional two-column layout
